    "In this example there are 3 rewards given to the agent depending on its performance solving the problem:\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:green\">+1.0, if the agent reaches the goal</span> - Given to the agent in the OnTriggerStay() (using the collider of the goal)\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:red\">-0.0005, for every step the agent does</span> - Given to the agent in MoveAgent(). This reward motivates the agent to find the optimal path to the goal (using as less movements as possible)\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:red\">-1.0, if the agent or the cube falls off the platform</span> - Given to the agent in AgentAction()\n",
